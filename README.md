# Customer-segmentation
Know your customer to boost your sales !!

#Inspiration
We as a team decided to do this project because many platforms like Netflix, Amazon use this technique to give recommendations to users . Which is very useful in this present generation .


#What it does
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers and prospects into different groups, each of which share characteristics and behave similarly within a segment, but look and behave differently across multiple segments.

#How I built it
First we collected the dataset. We used pandas library to classify the data and perform different operations on it. We used machine learning model(K-means clustering model) . Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.

#Accomplishments that I'm proud of
we finally, achieved to built a cluster model to classify the best choices for the customers according to the age . There are three main approaches to market segmentation: i)A priori segmentation , ii) Needs-based segmentation , iii) Value-based segmentation. we finally achieved all these and made easy choices for customers .

#What I learned
We learnt how to cluster the data by using Machine Learning model K-means Clustering . We also learnt panda library in python to classify the data .
